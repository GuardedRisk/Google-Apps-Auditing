Google Apps Auditing
====================

The tool acctwatch is used to monitor login's for Google Apps for Domains
accounts, and send periodic emails to designated email addresses to notify of
logins, failed logins and what locations these logins are coming from based
upon GeoIP information.

This information can then be used to make sure that user accounts have not been
compromised, or simply logged for a variety of other reasons.

Limitations
-----------

Due to limitations in the data provided by Google, this will only check logins
that occur on the website, IMAP logins, Calendar logins and others are not
provided unfortunately, thus this tool does not provide a complete picture of
all logins.
